<em>Web Basics</em><br>
HTML or HyperTextMarkupLanguage<br>
URLs<br>
HTTP<br>
Web Applications<br><br>
<p>The web is a collection of text docs, videos, images, music, HTML (main type of content) etc.<br>
HTML is the basis for everything on the web, it consists of: text content, markup(what content looks<br>
like and its arrangement), references to other documents(images, video, etc), and links aka hyperlinks<br>
to other pages.</p>
<p>HTTP is used by the internet to communicate with you, your browser, and servers(bunch of computers<br>
communicating with each other). How this works is when you go to a webpage that page sends a http<br>
request to server which finds the corresponding HTML which is sent back to your computers web browser<br>
which then interprets and displays the page.</p>
<p><em>HTML Markup</em><br>
HTML markup consists of tags, typically an opening and closing tag, however a closing tag is not always<br>
necessary. This is true in the case of 'void' tags, the content located between tags will be referred to in this<br>
course as an 'element'. For tags that are not void tags, if you forget the closing tag, everything after the<br>
opening tag will have the given effect you have written for the computer to translate. The tags I have learned<br>
about so far include: b(bold), em(emphasis, italic), img(image, void tag), a(anchor, for making links), br(break,<br>
new line), p(paragraph, creates invisible box), span, div, strong, and form(these last four have effects which<br>
are still slightly unclear to me, I think strong and div are bold and paragraph?).</p>
<p><em>HTML Attributes</em><br>
  Some tags can be given attributes which have corresponding values, tags can have multiple attributes, and<br>
  you can have tags within tags. For example the anchor tag must have the href attribute with a corresponding<br>
  which is the web page, followed by content which provides the link, followed by a closing tag. Another example<br>
  would be the image tag or img with the attribute src(source, website) followed by the value, followed by the <br>
  'content' which will be the link. It is nice to include the alt attribute in the case of an image which will display an<br>
  error message in the event of being unable to load the image. 
</p>
<p><em>Inline vs Block</em><br>
  Inline elements simply end a line of text (like br tag), and block elements creat an invisible box(not blank line)<br> around the text
  like in the case of a paragraph or p tag. Examples of inline include a, span, div, br, img, strong <br>tags. Examples of 
  block include div, p, and form tags.

<p><em>5 Things to Remember from this Lesson</em><br>
  -What a web page is: text document written in language called HTML. Web browsers read, interpret, and <br>
  display this<br>
  -How coding works: coding is written text in a language that computers can read and understand<br>
  -Computers are Stupid: the syntax MUST BE CORRECT for the computer to understand.<br>
  -Basic HTML Vocab: tags, elements, attributes<br>
  -Programmers Can't Remember Everything: theres too many details for one person to remember but thats<br>
  okay because you can just look it up
